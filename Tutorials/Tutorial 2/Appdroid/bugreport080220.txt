Hi Appdroid,

So I actually made your Sudoku World program crash.
I should tell you, back in my day, programs were not so easy to crash.
They were written robustly. They were written properly.
These days, program writers are just so lazy and don't even test their own code!

Honestly, I don't even know why I bothered buying your software in the first place.
0/10 would not recommend

Cheers,
Alistair
